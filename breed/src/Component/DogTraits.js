      <p>The Lhasa apso is a small non-sporting dog breed from Tibet that has a long, silky coat, which is touted for being low-shedding. Some owners trim the coat short in what’s called a “puppy cut” for easier maintenance. The Lhasa apso’s eyes are typically dark and oval, and its tail curls over its back. Overall, these dogs have a well-balanced build. They are hardy little dogs that tend to be smart and confident but also comical. Their history dates back centuries as a guard dog.</p>
